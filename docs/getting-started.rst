Getting started
===============

This is where you describe how to get set up on a clean install, including the
commands necessary to get the raw data (using the `sync_data_from_s3` command,
for example), and then how to make the cleaned, final data sets.

1. Download Make. Windows: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm MacOS: http://developer.apple.com/
2. Create a python3 virtual environment for this project and activate it. 
3. In your terminal enter `make data`, which will install dependencies, download the raw data, and process it. Downloading the data may take a few minutes.
