drug-labels
==============================

The objective of this project is to build two NLP models and showcase them using a simple web app. The first model classifies a drug’s route of administration (oral, topical, etc.) based on its label’s dosage and administration text. The second model is unsupervised and extracts topics from the dosage and administration text. These two models will then be compared. The <a target="_blank" href="https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/label/">OpenFDA API</a> is the project's data source.
